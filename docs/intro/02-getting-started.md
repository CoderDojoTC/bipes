# Getting Started

Before getting started with BIPES, follow the directions below to setup your microcontroller.

## Setup

However, before getting started with BIPES, your microcontroller board must be setup.  Regardless of which board you are using, you should start by doing the following steps:

1. Get the latest firmware release from [MicroPython.org](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/)

    - Download the latest stable uf2 file to your computer

2. Hold down the boot button on the board (white button)

    - Plug one end of the USB cable into the board and the other end into your computer

    - Release the boot button

3. The Pico will show up as a new drive (labeled RPI-RP2) available on your computer

4. Copy the downloaded uf2 file onto the RPI-RP2 drive

    - The Pico will reboot and be ready to use

    - The RPI-RP2 drive will no longer be visable on your computer.
