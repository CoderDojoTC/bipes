# An introduction to BIPES

## What is BIPES

BIPES: Block based Integrated Platform for Embedded Systems allows text and block based programming for several types of embedded systems and Internet of Things modules using MicroPython. You can connect, program, debug and monitor several types of boards using a serial  USB connection.  [BIPES can be found online](https://bipes.net.br/pico/ui/). 

## Why BIPES is Fun

BIPES hides the complexity of MicroPython by allowing users to program microcontrollers via an easy to use graphical interface.  BIPES has several built in libraries that make adding accessories to your microcontroller simple.  The underlying code can be view in the console, giving the interested user the ability to learn as they build on coding concepts.
