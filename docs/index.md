BIPES Block Programming with MicroPython

Block-based Integrated Platform for Embedded Systems (BIPES), an open source project developed in partnership with a range of universities to develop a drag-and-drop visual programming environment for the embedded world, has support for the Raspberry Pi Pico and its RP2040 microcontroller.   BIPES has been extended to add support for the RP2040 family of processors, the Raspberry Pi Pico W, and the Maker Pi RP2040 based Optum Bot.  BIPES can be run online as well as locally.
