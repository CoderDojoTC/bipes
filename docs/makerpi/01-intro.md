# Introduction to using a Maker Pi RP2040 board with BIPES

These lessons assume that you have at least skimmed the [Getting Started](http://www.coderdojotc.org/micropython/getting-started/01-intro/) sections and have selected the Maker Pi RP2040 in BIPES to write your code.

The lessons will introduce you to using BIPES with the $10 Maker Pi RP2040 board and the $20 OptumBot.

The first example uses the Maker Pi RP2040 and its internal LED in a similar manner to the exercise that was done with the Raspberry Pi Pico. The subsequent examples will repeat many of the previous examples, then add the unique capabilities of the Maker Pi RP2040.
