# Introduction to using a Raspberry Pico with BIPES

These lessons assume that you have at least skimmed the [Getting Started](http://www.coderdojotc.org/micropython/getting-started/01-intro/) sections and have selected the Raspberry Pi Pico in BIPES to write your code.

The lessons will introduce you to using BIPES with the $4 Raspberry Pi Pico.

The first example just use the Raspberry Pi Pico and and its internal LED. All the subsequent examples will require you to place components on a solderless breadboard.
