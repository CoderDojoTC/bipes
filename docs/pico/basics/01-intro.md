# Introduction to using a Raspberry Pico with BIPES

This lesson assumes that you have at least skimmed the [Getting Started](http://www.coderdojotc.org/micropython/getting-started/01-intro/) sections and have selected the Raspberry Pi Pico in BIPES to write your code.

The lesson will introduce you to the basic concepts of using BIPES using the $4 Raspberry Pi Pico.

The first two examples just use the Raspberry Pi Pico and don't require a breadboard or wiring. All the subsequent examples will require you to place components on a solderless breadboard.
