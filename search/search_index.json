Why BIPES is Fun BIPES hides the complexity of MicroPython by allowing users to program microcontrollers via an easy to use graphical interface. BIPES has several built in libraries that make adding accessories to your microcontroller simple. The underlying code can be view in the console, giving the interested user the ability to learn as they build on coding concepts.","title":"About BIPES"},{"location":"intro/01-intro/#an-introduction-to-bipes","text":"","title":"An introduction to BIPES"},{"location":"intro/01-intro/#what-is-bipes","text":"BIPES: Block based Integrated Platform for Embedded Systems allows text and block based programming for several types of embedded systems and Internet of Things modules using MicroPython.
