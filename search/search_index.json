You can connect, program, debug and monitor several types of boards using a serial USB connection. Why BIPES is Fun BIPES hides the complexity of MicroPython by allowing users to program microcontrollers via an easy to use graphical interface. BIPES has several built in libraries that make adding accessories to your microcontroller simple. The underlying code can be viewed in the console, giving the interested user the ability to learn as they build on coding concepts. About this site This site provides a rich collection of resources to teach computational thinking to students from 10 to 16 years old using fun programs that control the physical world around us. The sub-field of computer science that reads sensors and controls lights and motors is called Physical Computing. You can read about physical computing on our MicroPython site. Want to learn more? This site will concentrate on using BIPES to program the Raspberry Pi Pico and the Cytron Maker Pi 2040 boards. The lessons are based, in part, on the MicroPython lessons covered in our MicroPython for Kids site. A discussion of how a breadboard works , different types of microcontrollers , and the Raspberry Pi Pico are all covered on that site.","title":"About BIPES"},{"location":"intro/01-intro/#an-introduction-to-bipes","text":"","title":"An introduction to BIPES"},{"location":"intro/01-intro/#what-is-bipes","text":"BIPES (Block based Integrated Platform for Embedded Systems) allows text and block based programming for several types of embedded systems and Internet of Things modules using MicroPython.

Setup However, before getting started with BIPES, your microcontroller board must be setup. Regardless of which board you are using, you should start by doing the following steps: Download the flash_nuke.utf file to your computer. Download the latest MicroPython utf file to your computer. Hold down the BOOTSEL button on the Pico or the BOOT button on the Maker Pi then connect your microcontroller board to your computer with a micro usb cable and it will appear as a drive onto which you can drag the flash_nuke.uf2 file If you don't see the Maker Pi board, make sure the on/off switch is in the on position before connecting to your computer. Once the drive reappears, copy the MicroPython utf file to your device. If you are having trouble, take a look at the Drag-and-Drop MicroPython page Working with BIPES Working with BIPES is easy, since there is nothing to load on your computer. BIPES can be found online . Once the Welcome screen loads in your browser, you can do the following: Close the Welcome screen Select your board: The Raspberry Pi Pico The Maker Pi RP2040 Connect to your board Serial connection Select the comm port for your board The left navigation pane contains all of the blocks you will need to run the examples for the Raspberry Pi Pico and the Maker Pi RP2040 microcontrollers.

The only things you need to run this program are BIPES a USB cable a $4 Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller Blinking the Builtin LED The pico has a single built in green LED wired to logical pin 25. We call this GPIO 25. GPIO means General Purpose Input and Output pin. Here is a sample program that you can use. Don't worry about understanding each block yet. We will cover the various parts in later sections. Take a look at the left navigation. Each section in the navigation contains different items that you will use to run your program. We used blocks from Loops , Logic , Machine:In_Out Pins , and Timing . The green block comes from the Loops navigation section. Anything inside the green block repeats while true . true comes from the Logic navigation section. Thus the program will run forever, or until we stop it. The first blook inside the loop comes from the Machine:In/Out Pins navigation section. We are setting the onboard LED to true (on). The next block is a delay for 1/2 second. The delay comes from the Timing navigation section. We repeat those two blocks, this time setting the onboard LED to false (off). Changing the Blink Speed Next, lets create a variable from the Variable navigation section for the delay that the LED is on and off. The number in the delay block comes from the Math navigation section. This program will blink the built-in LED on and off every 1/4 of a second. By changing the delay variable you can make the LED blink faster and slower. Challenge What is the fastest you can make the LED blink and still see it changing? What does this tell you about the human eye? Blinking external LEDs Although the builtin LED is convenient, you can use the code to blink any nmber of external LEDs that are connected through a 330 ohm resister in series to the LED. Hints: We will assume that LEDs are connected to pins GPIO16 and GPIO17 and are connected via a 330 ohm resistor to ground. The longer lead on the LED is the Anode (+) lead, connect it to the GPIO pins on the pico Modify the first program Note which GPIO pins are connected to each LED Here are the blocks that will blink the LEDs that are connected to GPIO16 & GPIO17, this time 10 times.","title":"Blink"},{"location":"pico/basics/blink/#blink-in-bipes","text":"","title":"Blink in BIPES"},{"location":"pico/basics/blink/#overview","text":"In this lab, we will use BIPES to make the green on-board LED on the Raspberry Pi Pico blink on and off every half second.
